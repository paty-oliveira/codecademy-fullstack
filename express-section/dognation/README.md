# Dognation: Password Authentication

Dognation is collaborative site for dogwalkers to share pictures of their buddies. People can sign in and post
pictures of the dogs they walk and share them with everyone!

We were recently hired to complete a missing feature for the app! It currently doesn’t have any configuration to
authenticate users. In this project, we’ll be using express-sessions, Passport’s passport-local, and bcrypt.js in
order to authenticate users so they can register, login and stay, and log out of the app!
