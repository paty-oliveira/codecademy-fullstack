# Film Finder

**Description:**
You’ve caught up on your list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look. In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.
